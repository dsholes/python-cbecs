    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume you're here because you're already familiar with [CBECS](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/about.php). The 2018 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) consists of Commercial Building characteristics, energy consumption and expenditures data, representing almost 6 million commercial buildings across the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EIA already provides [22 tables](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2018/index.php?view=characteristics) with detailed crosstabulations of 2018 CBECS building characteristics data, and [48 tables](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2018/index.php?view=consumption) with cross tabulations of CBECS consumption, expenditures, and end-use data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for those who are comfortable with data analysis, EIA also provides the CBECS \"[microdata](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2018/index.php?view=microdata)\", and accompanying codebook. This microdata (available as CSV):\n",
    ">contains 6,436 records. They represent commercial buildings from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each record **corresponds to a single response from an in-scope building** in the sample. The sample represents an estimated 5.9 million total buildings in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, each row of the CSV represents one commercial building. So the microdata allows us to dive deeper into the data **at the facility level**, instead of the aggregations that EIA provides in the Building Characteristics and Energy Consumption/Expenditures tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "With it we can, for example, calculate the total Major Fuel (e.g. electricity, fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gases, natural gas, district steam, district hot water, and district chilled water) consumption for each Principal Building Activity (e.g. office, hospital, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "But, perhaps more interestingly, we can also look at the **descriptive statistics of the samples**, as opposed to just averages or aggregations, to (hopefully) develop a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the Commercial Sectors' energy consumption habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Notable Omission üêç\n",
    "There is a [CBECS User's Guide to the Public Use Microdata File](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/data/2018/pdf/Users%20Guide%20to%20the%202018%20CBECS%20Public%20Use%20Microdata%20File.pdf), with a set of examples in Excel, SAS and R. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, considering it's prominence as a lingua franca in the data world, a notable omission is any relevant examples for Python. We'll re-create the 6 Excel examples from the CBECS microdata User's Guide using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've built some tools to help you hit the ground running with CBECS microdata in Python. The following assumes familiarity with the Python package `pandas`, and it's primary data types, `DataFrames` and `Series`."
