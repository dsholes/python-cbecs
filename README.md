# CBECS Analysis Tools

## Getting Started
1. Install `micromamba` or `miniconda`
2. Create `jupy` and `data` envs from `jupyenv.yaml` and `dataenv.yaml`
3. Run `download_cbecs_data.sh`
4. Launch Jupyter Lab from `jupy` env
5. Open `examples.ipynb` and run with `data` kernel

## Notes
- `examples.ipynb` is notebook that walk's through practical analysis examples in Python
- `pycbecs` is a helper module for working with CBECS data
